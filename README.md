Geothermal Power Generation Potential in the United States by 2050 (Reviewing)
```

## `./source/` contains source files for the study
* `egs_supply_curve_by_BA` and `egs_supply_curve_by_county` are EGS supply curves compiled in this study, with the latest estimations on cost project
* `Geothermal Cost Reduction Scenarios.xlsx` contains multiple cost reduction scenarios
* `GeoVision ReEDS Geothermal Supply Curve Inputs.xlsx` are original supply curves used in GeoVision study by NREL

## `./output/` contains selected results for the study
* All scenarios results (e.g. capacity, generation, emission...) are included in scenarios under `ReEDS`
* `EGS Supply Curves` contains EGS supply curve for all BAs of ReEDS

## Plot scripts
- `plot_supply_curves.R`: Plot EGS supply curves
- `plot_egs_cost_reduction.R`: Plot EGS cost reduction scenarios
